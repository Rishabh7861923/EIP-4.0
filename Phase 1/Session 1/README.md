## Definitions

#### 1.Convolution: It is the process in which a feature extractor moves over the input image to extract the features for input of next layer.

#### 2.Filters/Kernels: Kernels are used to *create the channels for the features*, by extracting features on the basis of **edges and gradients**.

#### 3.Epochs: It is one iteration of convolution through the network which gives us output at output layer after processing the whole dataset.

#### 4.1x1 Convolution: This convolution is used to **contextually link** the features. It does *not reconvolves* it *recombines* the features for **Z-channel dimensional reduction**.

#### 5.3x3 Convolution: It is the 3x3 kernel that convolves over the input and produces an output having dimensions reduced by 2. It can be used to form any kernel by combination.

#### 6.Feature Maps: It contains the collection of output features that are detected by our neural networks during the feature extraction by kernel.

#### 7.Activation Function: It is a function that decides wether that neuron will shoot for that specific feature or not.

#### 8.Receptive Field: The minimum requirement of pixels by the next layer inoder to completely visualize the input.
